# Car-Price-Prediction
Developed a predictive model using machine learning and deep learning methods to forecast car prices. In particular, I used scikit-learn to create an ensemble (stacking) model and Tensorflow/Keras to create a neural network with functional api. 
Year is the most important feature in the model. The next three are engine size, mileage, and mpg. There are good metric scores, such as r2 of 0.938 and
normalized mse of 0.0089, to indicate the model generalizes well.
